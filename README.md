# EvermoreMonsters
Evermore Monsters is a cardbuilding-tactics-adventure game about a spirit that wants to be a knight. Players will control a small team of characters that use cards drawn from a deck to perform actions in tactical, turn-based combat. 

This repo is part of my public facing portfolio, which contains a working build and samples of the code that went into the game. 

The last version of this game contains a few levels with exploration, combat, and some light puzzle mechanics.
